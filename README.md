# Shopee Feedbacks Analysis

This is my first machine learning apply project in my study at UIT. In my fourth semester learning there.

This project marks a significant milestone in my personal development on the journey of learning to code. I have learned a lot, including front-end development with React, web scraping, building and deploying machine learning models, building servers with Flask, and more. 

# How to use
When users want to buy a product on Shopee, but there are a hugeeeee number of feedbacks there. Users don't know how to summarize all of them. 
This is the time my application used for. Users paste the link of their product to the form
After a short delay, website returns valuable informations for users, include:
- How much positive, negative, neutral / spam / non sense feedbacks
- Some feedbacks that users want to read
- A vector search system, users can search based on keywords, then website return some feedbacks relevent to that keywords. Something like "shipment delay", or "packaging quality"

# About the website
The React front end is still deployed at [Vercal](https://shopee-feedback.vercel.app/).
Unfortunately, due to Shopee policy and the funding issue, I stopped the server side.
The demo is in the (Demo.mp4).

Although there are still many flaws, this website remains a source of pride for me because it is my very first product and has been recognized by my classmates and lecturers.
